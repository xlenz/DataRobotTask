## Task Description
https://gist.github.com/bratchenko/990f024e11fd09e6b6bf

We need to know if you understand how web applications are created and how they are tested.
This task includes both.

It also shows if you are able to learn new tools and technologies, so we specify
which ones you should use. If you already know all of them - good for you :)

The task is to create a simple web application that does following:

1. It shows 10 random numbers to user. They must have duplicates among them.
2. User should click on numbers that have duplicates and they are removed from the list.
3. If user clicks on a number that doesn't have duplicate in the list, "Game over" message
   is displayed and user can't click on numbers anymore.
4. If user successfully removes all the duplicate numbers, "Victory" message is displayed.

Please, make it look nice by using some styling.

Then write end-to-end tests for this application.

* Use http://flask.pocoo.org/ for writing backend of the application.
* Use http://angular.github.io/protractor/ to write end-to-end tests for the application.

Both frameworks have nice examples on homepages, so if you didn't use any of them before,
you should be able to look at examples and figure out how to do it.

Put you solution to a public github repository where we can see it. It should contain
instructions about how to launch application and tests.

Send link to the repository to person who gave you this task.
